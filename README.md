# Welcome to my ToDo app, Just Dew It

Crafting using SwiftUI, my first functional project with swift.

About Just Dew It:
Feedback is welcome, looking to make this a free ToDo app some day to help people who struggle with managing daily tasks and dont want to feel bad about themselves if they cant meet todays goals. 
THis is meant to be a realstic approach to ToDos, understadning we dont always have the time we thoguht we did and also being flexible to allow more tasks when time allows. 
i want smooth animations with beautiful background with reliable and stable perforamnce.
